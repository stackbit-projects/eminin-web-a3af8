The reasons why clients decide to try counseling can be different. Reasons can concern private, family or professional life. These can be difficulties in emotional life, behavioral patterns that we repeat, partnerships, general relationships between people or life circumstances which are too stressful. Sometimes it can be finding your own life values and goals, and improving your own potential and personal growth.

### These are some of the most common reasons clients do the counseling:

* Responsive display on any size screen
* Light and Dark themes right out of the box
* Multilingual - supports side-by-side content in multiple languages
* Any number of custom index page sections from Markdown files
* _Projects_ section with any number of projects: highly configurable as a photo gallery, modals, or external links
* _Blog_ section with optional _Latest Post_, on the main page or as a separate section
* Styled Markdown throughout with support for Hugo's syntax highlighting
