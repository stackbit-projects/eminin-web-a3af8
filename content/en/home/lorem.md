I am originally from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and I have been living in Cologne, Germany for the last two years. I completed my psychology studies in Sarajevo and after that I received additional education in various therapeutic approaches (cognitive-behavioral approach, ACT, Schema approach).
I worked in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a psychologist in various organizations for the last 10 years. I gained extensive experience working with trauma patients in a non-governmental organization which provides support to women and children who have survived some form of violence. I then worked in a non-governmental organization for children with disabilities, where I gained experience in leading support groups for parents and other family members of children with disabilities. Working with children with disabilities and their families has been a great pleasure for me. I continued working with children through an engagement in one primary school in Sarajevo. After gained experience, I decided to start a private psychological practice with my colleagues in Sarajevo, where I worked until moving to Cologne.
I am glad to have the opportunity to do what I love the most again in Cologne.
