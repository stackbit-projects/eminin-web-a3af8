Cognitive-behavioral therapy is considered one of the most effective approaches. A large number of studies have confirmed the effectiveness of the methods and techniques used in this approach. The focus is on recognizing our thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, and behavioral patterns which arise through different situations. Using various techniques, focus is placed on changing the recognized dysfunctional patterns, regarding negative thoughts and behaviors, which maintain the current difficulties.
