Schema therapy is an approach that combines elements of different approaches and theories, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychoanalysis, attachment theory, transactional analysis. The main assumption from which the schema therapy starts is that the emotional needs of a child were not adequately met. Due to unmet children's needs, different types of schemes are developed that are maintained during adulthood, and they involve negative behavioral patterns and interaction with the environment. Built schemes or patterns have a role to reduce emotional stress, but can most often cause additional difficulties.
